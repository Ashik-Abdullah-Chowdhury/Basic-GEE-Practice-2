# **Understanding Client vs. Server in Google Earth Engine (GEE)**
## This repository provides an overview and code examples illustrating the differences between client-side and server-side processing in Google Earth Engine (GEE).

When working with Google Earth Engine, it's essential to understand the distinction between client-side and server-side processing:

**Client-Side Processing:** Refers to computations performed within the user's web browser or local environment. Client-side processing is typically used for tasks such as visualization, user interaction, and small-scale data manipulation.

**Server-Side Processing:** Refers to computations performed on Google's servers. Server-side processing is utilized for large-scale data analysis, processing massive datasets, and complex geospatial algorithms.

Some examples of applications are shown below:

# **Bangladesh Administrative Boundary Analysis with Google Earth Engine (GEE)**
## This part of the repository provides a guidance and code example for downloading administrative boundary data of Bangladesh, uploading Upazila boundary shapefiles to Google Earth Engine (GEE), and filtering specific Upazilas for analysis.


1.   **Downloading Administrative Boundary Data:** Obtained administrative boundary data of Bangladesh from a reliable source in google.
2.   **Uploading Upazila Boundary Shapefile to GEE:** Uploaded Upazila boundary shapefiles to GEE's asset tab for further analysis.
3.   **Filtering Upazila:** Filtered "Boalkhali" Upazila for further analysis.
4.   **Perimeter,area of Upazila:** Printed the perimeter and area of Boalkhali.
5.   **Visualize the filtered Upazila:** Showed Boalkhali upazila on the map.

The result is:
